# CSE538_FinalProject

Please provide a google drive link to your packaged code or give us a link to your github repo hosting these. The code should be structured with a README that clearly specifies the following: 1. List the original source for your code base. Include the URL to the original source. 2. The list of files that you modified and the specific functions within each file you modified for your project. 3. A list of commands that provide how you train and test your baseline and the systems you built. 4. A list of the major software requirements that are needed to run your system. (E.g. Tensorflow 2.3, Python 243.12, CUDA abd2.0, nltk2401.11, allen-nlp 5.0). These descriptions should be adequate enough to help anyone who wants to run your system
